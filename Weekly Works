## Week 1（9/6-15/6）: Ideation and Conceptualization
During the week, I thought about the type of game and theme in my head. I would like to make an adventure fiction game. It's about time travel and non-linear narratives. This has been a hobby of mine for a long time. Also, because of my own aesthetic, I designed the game in a 2D horizontal pixel style.
