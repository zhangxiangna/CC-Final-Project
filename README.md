Creative Computing 22f Final Project: Game Design: The Wheel of Time 

## Week 1（9/6-15/6）: Ideation and Conceptualization
During the week, I thought about the type of game and theme in my head. I would like to make an adventure fiction game. It's about time travel and non-linear narratives. This has been a hobby of mine for a long time. Also, because of my own aesthetic, I designed the game in a 2D horizontal pixel style.

## Week 2 (June 16 - June 22): Concept Finalization and Initial Meeting

I Finalize the game concept: a 2D pixel-styled visual novel game with time-travel elements and some ethical and moral reflections. As well as during the week, I investigated some related games and create a research document outlining your initial ideas and inspirations. Meet with my supervisor to discuss the project scope and objectives.
