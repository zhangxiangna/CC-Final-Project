Creative Computing 22f Final Project: Game Design: The Wheel of Time 

## Week 1（9/6-15/6）: Ideation and Conceptualization
During the week, I thought about the type of game and theme in my head. I would like to make an adventure fiction game. It's about time travel and non-linear narratives. This has been a hobby of mine for a long time. Also, because of my own aesthetic, I designed the game in a 2D horizontal pixel style.

## Week 2 (June 16 - June 22): Concept Finalization and Initial Meeting

I Finalize the game concept: a 2D pixel-styled visual novel game with time-travel elements and some ethical and moral reflections. As well as during the week, I investigated some related games and create a research document outlining your initial ideas and inspirations. Meet with my supervisor to discuss the project scope and objectives.

## Week3-Week6 (23/6/2023-20/7/2023) : Research

Play games similar to your concept, like Disco Elysium, Road 96. Read literature about non-linear narratives, like Arrivals, to understand their mechanics and storytelling. Record some of the elements that I find attractive to incorporate within my game.

## Week7-Week9(21/7/2023-10/8/2023): World Building and Story

Develop the game's world, including the setting, backstory and game plot. Create detailed profiles for main characters and NPCs. Write the initial drafts of the story scripts and dialogue.

I can't put it up in its entirety because the game plot document I wrote has over 10,000 words. If you're interested, you can click this link: (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cVnI4G6P64Auf2cwGjgl5idk-e6_gdw5/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=117307447688610825269&rtpof=true&sd=true)

## Week9-Week12(4/8/2023-31/8/2023)：Asset Design and Production

Design in-game assets: scenarios, player characters, NPCs, and animations. Develop the UI, focusing on user experience and aesthetic coherence. Begin creating initial animations and character designs.

### Characters Design:

## Week 13(1/9/2023-7/9-2023): Starting in UNITY

Set up the game project in Unity. Implement basic dialogue frames and character animations. Test initial animations and dialogue systems for functionality.

## Week14 (8/9/2023-14/9/2023): Developing the first chapter

Creating the first chapter in unity, including character animation, scene switching, dialog introduction, and puzzle creation. One in particular I'd like to mention is the puzzle creation for a light-up game where I spent some time.

Here's the code for my light-up game design:

## Week15(15/9/2023-21/9/2023): Second Meeting

Second meeting with my supervisor We had an in-depth discussion about the content of the game and the development process in unity. Since I've only made it to the first chapter in unity and I wanted my supervisor to know all of my plots and playthroughs, I created a rough draft as one of the materials for the meeting.

Unfortunately, my supervisor told me that my game has too much content, and that I should minimize my workload by cutting out as many unnecessary episodes as possible. After discussing this, I cut my game down from eight chapters to three. (This decision has since been proven to be the right one.) (As well as this is why I've kept the images above small, as most of them have been put on hold for now.)

## Week16-17(22/9/2023-5/10/2023): Developing the Second chapter

Develop the second chapter, focusing on advancing the story and gameplay complexity. In this chapter, the main task of the Player is to return to the Middle Ages to rescue a young man. There are not many puzzles designed in this chapter, and the player needs to get information through dialogues to complete the reasoning. So the focus in this chapter is on animation and dialog design.
Dialogue:

## Week20(20/10/2023-26/10/2023): Testing & Feedback

During the week, I invited five friends to give my game a try. They looked for bugs in my game and I made changes to the bugs and recorded their feedback on the game.

## Week21(27/10/2023-2/11/2023): Outlining

Begin outlining my essay. Focus on the introduction and background, detailing my inspiration and objectives for the game. Outline the structure and main points you plan to cover.
